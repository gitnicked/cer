Look at me like I'm the bomb,
Run away from me don't say shalom
Let you inside of my home
Now you will say that I don't need a throne,
Now you will say that I act like a clone
Then you will say I've been actin' unknown
Then you will say that I ain't actin' grown
Fuck you bitch I'll go live alone,

I will go own the moon
Shine like the stars reflectin' off cars
Get me a superstar
Words are so strong and I'll stop all the wars,
Got me some marble thats coatin' my floors
Brush on the back of my snowy white horse,
Don't have a wife I don't like the divorce,
Don't like Versache I dont like the stores,

Back on track say sum get slapped,
Never been strapped but I never said that,
Life's kinda bad but I know its a trap
to make me reach for the hammer and crack
Holes in my skull cause my lifes so dull
So now theres a window in my mental,
Glowing light shines through my temples
and they overreach like I'm the devil,

Blah blah blah keep talking 'bout me
Your dumbass words just empower me
To keep being myself like I'm so free
Like Ye but I never was nazi,
My night vision let's me see in the dark
and explosive hearts make the best art
In the underground is where I'll go park
Till' they restrain me and keep me apart, yeah,`,

Let me live and sleep under the stars
Can I get a kiss from you,
Do it first then let me fly, Can I get a
(instrumental break)
All my dreams are about you,
About you,


[VERSE 1]
Always said that when I do my closer
Have a grand way of telling you its over,
Admit to a mic when I'm feeling lower,
But now shit feelin' like a blur,

Don't know what to say, so I go and pray,
Pushing bad thoughts like stay away,
Ain't got no friends feel like a stray
Don't know what ima go do today,

I guess, I'll go fuck myself,
Fuck myself like I always do,'
Woke up already feelin' blue
I look around, look around for who

Don't know myself like I thought I did,
Always said I don't need nobody,
But now I feel like I need somebody,
Lost focus in every hobby, I did

Life's ruled by insecurities
not like I thought'd it be, honestly
Maybe just a fraud, actin' like a god,
Just my flawed philosophu, yeah,

Explain to me this,
How do I think that I'm the best,
But I also think that I'm the worst,
Wanna kill myself badly yet,

I'm so scared of getting burned,
Still feel like my death is earned,
Still feel like my death is deserved
It all leaves me so unnerved,
 
Morals lost like my father who left me,
Ego present so you can't forget me,
Insecurity high so you can affect me,
Trust is low so I can't let me live, yeah,

Let me live and sleep under the stars
Can I get a kiss from you,
Do it first then let me fly, Can I get a

All my dreams are about you,
About you,

[VERSE 2]
Never left despite temptations,
Never expressed their frustrations,
Always stuck by the obligations,
You have the nerve to blame me?

My thoughts expressed, thats how I stay free,
Was told being myself was the only key,
Just being real I'm never real,
It's so unreal how we seek appeal,

I never learned how to vent others,
A curse where you can't be a brother,
To the ones searching for a purpose,
Cause all my advise is just surface,

I'll say I care but I really don't
And I want to but I know I won't
So why come here and lie to you
Cause I would never lie to you,

How you gon' be confident and hate yourself at the same time?
Like you seen everyone's life play out ' in a thousand lifetimes
Like you feel every word you when you say that next rhyme,
Would sell your soul for a cheque and buy that shit back with a dime,

You live for yourself so I hate you cause I only live for others
And my face only shows a cover so they milk me from my udders
I hear mutters it's about me so I run fore I get swiss cheesed
Life's struck on a thin lease I'm the bank but without greed,

[CHORUS // Sung]
Let me live and sleep under the stars
Can I get a kiss from you,
Do it first then let me fly, Can I get a

    lyrics: `[Chorus]
Taking them down like I’m 25 but they looking at me like I’m 29
Makin' better beats than industry lies and I ain't '25
Hazy all in my eyes but I ain't ever laid them on gold,
Harder than the night save my legacy carve my name into stone
When I see your stacks I spoil myself and buy me like two homes
Takin' a note from yeezy and makin' myself like ten domes,
Never give yourself away for hoes that work with false hopes
Hopin' they'll be saved by fuckin' on real ones with large goals

[Verse 1]
I’ve been feeling so Japanese yeah I’m overseas but I still see
See the way that she looked at me then asked why I am lonely
When eyes rest on my face, created space with my own thoughts
I want more but at the same time I can’t let myself get that close
Pathetic man in the mirror stares, dares me to go cut my hair
Dares me to stop acting fair, get money, be a millionaire
Japanese after 45 my mind hurts and I spit lies
Wide open I'm all eyes I’m fake even when I don’t try

I know I said I’m 25 cause I’m already done with life
Grabbed the knife when it hit 5
Lucky chance that I don’t die
Hate myself it's common news, have no one I can’t tell it to
Pissed off when I think of you, imagine if I had,

If I just, If I just

If they just knew what I’m going through
Maybe they come and help me do
All the things that I wanted to
Too tough that I couldn’t chew
Wouldn’t let myself do it anyway
In the end I’m just a runaway

[Chorus]
Taking them down like I’m 25 but they looking at me like I’m 29
Makin' better beats than industry lies and I ain't '25
Hazy all in my eyes but I ain't ever laid them on gold,
Harder than the night save my legacy carve my name into stone
When I see your stacks I spoil myself and buy me like two homes
Takin' a note from yeezy and makin' myself like ten domes,
Never give yourself away for hoes that work with false hopes
Hopin' they'll be saved by fuckin' on real ones with large goals

[Verse 2]
(humming)

Looking at me like I’m 45 and I just got cancer and can’t survive
Deprived my thoughts of my own demise my real tears surface I’m not surprised
Claim I love myself, that’s not true
Pathetic the way I’m throwing out clues
Alone by myself cause life’s a cruise
Waves lap around me but I left the crew
At home so I did for my friends and family
I don’t know how I have the audacity
My capacity for empathy, deep inside of me an embassy
That I don’t let anybody into, reservations I can’t look into
Too many thoughts that I cannot pursue
Interacting feels like a taboo

God, yeah oh God

I lie to me and I lie to you, we're more similar when my thoughts get simpler
And I gave up too, I’m ready to fuck it up
Give it up, control the truck, steer until I’m off a cliff
Stiff arms with stiffer lips when I’m around you, you know
Cause I need to tell you so bad but our interests don’t overlap

[Chorus]
Taking them down like I’m 25 but they looking at me like I’m 29
Makin' better beats than industry lies and I ain't '25
Hazy all in my eyes but I ain't ever laid them on gold,
Harder than the night save my legacy carve my name into stone
When I see your stacks I spoil myself and buy me like two homes

My minds split on Familicide my mind calls for the father died
The same father never raised me now familicide is a homicide
For my body soul and the youthful side of me who never acted truthful
For thoughts nah I was influenced by family they all telling me
Violence never the answer but to me the blood don't matter
Pastor confessions come later first cleaver justcies the related traitor,
Baiter baiter you baitin' me to come quick like I'm a masterbaiter
Half creator and yet I'm greater familicide now I'm your failure,

I'm on familicide and Imma see the end,
I'm on familicide and Imma see the end,
Stab you in the chest
Bring you quick to an early end,
I'm on familicide and Imma see the end,
I'm on familicide and Imma see the end,
Stab you in the chest
Bring you quick to an early end,

In my dreams i hallucinate and I boast myself I'm so great
Your death day is on my date its chosen like a birthday
Bullet spread catch on your face cause god gave me a lucky spray
Recognize me you can't say even though we look the fucking same,
You only end on my conditions and die slow in all my visions
So I call that night (laugh // implied i would say vision but i laugh instead), that been clear do I have to say?
Cause we both know you'll never change,
And I know that I'll never change,
Your DNA is why I'm deranged, and I hate you cause I'm the same,

[Verse 3]
Let me list out my fantasies familicide you ain't family
That's why I can say it so happily that I want to see you dead
In my eyes lay no regret for every word that I fuckni said
My hands gripped around your neck and I choke like I want respect,
Choke like I haven't slept and I hold just for a lil long,
Sing a song that lasts lifelong once it's over I loosen my grip
Then I'll let your body slip then I'll let your scalp chip,
Open, reverse your eyes all done with a closed lip on my face,
Live for more than a simple chase, bad father bad son, familicide,`,

Let me stare to those pretty eyes and let me see the light fade,
Hung from under the trees, loss cast by the shade
I've been feelin' betrayed, I've been feelin' betrayed,
Don't know what to do, I'm killing myself today,
Rays of sun catch over me, lifes over like probably
Same flows like constantly, I pour my heart out honestly
Been stalking since sixteen my eyes never laid off,
Eyes locked like a standoff, fought urges been too tough,
I'll say that I feel bad, we all lie to ourselves,
Fuck myself, Fuck myself, Fuck myself 'till I can't breath,
Your pretty ass in those blue jeans teasin' me so easily
Screaming turned me on and I learned that at eleven,
and ever since that day I knew I couldn't go to heaven,
and ever since that day I knew I had to own a weapon,
I knew, I knew, yeah that's my intention,
You're a demon in my thoughts, and I'm the reverend
Six six six, but you're a seven and three,
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy,
I'm losing my mind everytime I think of you,
Rope in my hands and unreasonable demands
I remember the day so vividly and perfectly,
I was so hungry for your fucking body,
Glock in my back pocket, you're an outlet for my socket
It's a sunny day and I'm staring at your locket,
cause it's between your breasts inside the swell of your chest
And I'm depressed because I'm so obsessed with sex,
And now you're my target, a hole for my rocket,
Crop tops and blonde pins, blue jeans and big tits,
Green eyes, I'm all lies, that's no surprise
Can you try my food that I made just for you?
GHB now take an E add to the end of R-A-P
That's my dreams, that's my dream,
I've been waiting since middle school ever since you was fourteen
and now I finally get my chance to wipe your thoughts clean
I brought her back home and laid her prone bone,
Jeans down to ankles, both of us and I'm still alone,
Tapped twice checking if you woke while staring at that pretty throat,
I know I can't let you go once I do what I'm going to
Cleaver benched on the bench and I wrench up her arms
With that rope from before, phone off don't alarm,
Her parents or the police, now I'm ready for my treat,
Hands all over her ass and my hands grope so brash
'till it's red like it's a rash as if she was dancing for cash,
Every thrust I did that day I have no regrets,
Three wounds the news said, each for every year I missed,
Staring into those pretty eyes,  into those pretty eyes,
I could only recognize the loss of a vibrant glow,
Take one last look at that pretty face,`,

Night Vision I see all my senses
I kiss bliss to show my reverence
Green eyes, you get the reference
Prince of you that's my role
I control my own soul,
Burn black like charcoal,
Come save yourself from my thoughts
Save yourself from the afterthoughts
With your parents in a long walk
Explain to them why you hate me
Don't even love you already
I'll capture you with my m3
I'll be the number one MC
I make all of my own beats
and I drag women by their feet
Out the door like come see
Brown eyes comes from my eyes
like blood after the sun fries
From the wounds that haven't sealed
Inside and outside and my lies
Don't get disguised its for you to see
It was never for the money
It was never for the approval
And I was never truthful
I'm an intellectual
and I am hypersexual
which fuels my rage and hightens senses
View you from my wiped lenses
Endless nights thinking of thoughts
Endless nights of thinking of lots
of those inside my mind
Never claimed to be kind
I will stalk you through the night
Then I will make my decision
Held inside of my future visions
So I call that night vision,
I call you my favorite chicken
Chopped with expert precision,
While I dream of our future children
Too bad I just did division
You are one in a million
So eight thousand more are given
As a prize just for me living
I hope we'll be there kissing
I hope we'll be there sitting
Always really wanted a sister
not to love her and more to kiss her
Really though, I already miss her
and I don't even fucking know her,
I look at objects and they speak to me
Regenerative properties,
Come from a golden breeze,
That only I can see,
And they ask why I'm lonely,
I can't understand the population,
I wanna create my own nation
where I'm the only person staying
And I'm the only person claiming
To be the motherfucking greatest
One day imma fuckin' end it
Not before I take you with
We can both die as a myth
Rest in my arms lets turn to ashes,
Kill me then present to masses`,

By the time you listen I'm sure that you'll hate me,
I don't care reputations that's why I say anything
And if people heard my shit then I'd be hated by many
But I'm so self aware, so how could yall go and hate me,
I say what I think out loud sometimes I say what I mean
At least my lyrics not generated from a machine,
And at least I go out and I produce all my beats
By myself, so that I'm left as the only freak, I mean,
(Pause) Yall treat me like I'm dressed up on halloween,
and I'm out hurtin' children or hunting from a screen,
I'm sorry that my lyrics are rapey and kinda obscene
Perfect for you to come right into my face and come scream,
That's a little extreme, but that's just my opinion,
Billion other songs you could choose go listen,
Since you chose me, I guess that I feel honored
'nother pair of ears that my shitty shit just conquered,
I don't do metaphors, not smart enough for that,
I just say stories and make them up as I go,
One story a day I'll feed you two for tomorrow,
Three if you swallow, see I'm being obscene,
My mind is kinda black I don't have no new ideas
Dictionary by my side and my shit still don't rhyme
Unrelated bars like damn I like the sunshine
Playing in the fields frolicking in the summertime
I say shit just to say it, it don't really have a meaning
Maybe it does sometimes, it's a little demeaning
To say that I don't mean none cause then I'd be fake
I mean who am I lying, who am I trying to impress,
All my visions of success, disappear when I don't rest,
Sad face I'm so depressed, mad face I'm so stressed
Focused now I'm takin' tests, god level I am blessed,
Happy face I'm obsessed, Saint Nick I'm the best
(laugh) what do I even say?
I always talk 'bout they, okay stay away,
I need my alone time, need it today,
That's how I want, to spend my sunday,
Women women women I have just one opinion
I really like women especially havin children
But y'know like the act, not the actual child
I mean that'd be wild, imagine me with a child,

[Verse 2]
I'm out here just playin' cause no woman would love me (aw)
I mean they probably would if I actually tried
To go and better myself, but nah I shelter myself
Because I hated myself, I mean I prolly still do,
But there is all of this lusts that clouds all of my vision,
Vision vision vision I say that shit a lot
And I should probably stop, but it's part of the plot
That I see in the night, and that theme I won't top,
I need a theme, Kendrick has one
People like kendrick that means they'll like when I do it
But I guess when I do it,  my themes just won't do it
They like 'what did you say' but like you heard me just do it,
So give me some credit, I'm trying my best
And no, I'm not possessed, cause I talk 'bout incest,
I'm just joking right,
I'm just joking right, nah, alright,`,

Locked in making music with incestual desires
Sister lover thoughts excude from album's main writer
When born I nearly died mom said I'm a fighter
Maybe my lack of oxygen is what caused my desire
Sister loving paradox heart quick like megawatts
Right into my brain firing up all of the oxytocin
Broken mind from my obsession my morality in question
Non-existant if aroused so all thoughts forever drowned
Rap about taboos drowning sorrows with the booze
Introduced when I was nine to videos with the boobs
Addictive personalities brings taps on shoulders issa tease,
Pornography disease that I worship not degrees
Double X chromosones searched up on google chrome
Stone me for my thoughts mister sister lover in the home,
Then tomorrow let me name ya while I spell out my dreams
If I had to build, these would be the thing,
Five foot four with light skin so that she looks like me,
One year younger, eyes brown in color just like me
Cute face with a tiny waist as if she was just made for me
Mellow soul with zero goals so that she is just like me,
Build a sister right from scratch customizing I'll attatch
Parts I like the rest get scrapped, playin' god 'till I collapse
Disobey and I'll attack, disengage and I'll track
Every time I push a limit, count the seconds by the minute
Hey, look, It's mister sister fucker sitting with misses
no name sister while he's givin' kisses as  forgiveness,
Love me please I'm not pernicious, stab my heart like syringes,
You are what I need for riches, dreams like these are really viscious,

Spill my thoughts and I confessed, I'll be hanged for treason,
My pen writes as a tear slips I feel fear for my secrets
This  the conclusion to my life as I knew it,
I've been to desperate lying to everyone that I know
I'm a shit person for the things that I feel,
I'm a shit person for things I conceal,
I'm sorry man, lifes so unreal,

In the mirror I'm saint nick and in my songs I am perfect,
My production I learned it. my effort in I'm the shit,
But I didn't have a microphone so I held up my cellphone
To my lips then I spit all of the shit that's on my mind,
Night Vision I made that cause I'm the worst when the sky's dark,
But when my minds dark the heart comes with the best art,
Lose my guard for security and I let out thoughts thoroughly
Cry about how I'm lonely to beats that I ain't complete, yeah,

[Verse 3]
If ninety nine percent of relationships fail,
Then I'm that one percent that fell in love with himself,
Despite all of his struggles and ignoring his health
I watched as he went through his own personal hell
If I had a clone I'd take a look in his soul
See if theres something left, is it half is it whole,
Of course I have a soul because I have all these goals
I have my motivations all of which I control,

[Verse 4]
I know that I am the shit so when I talk about it,
I expect to be treated like I'm a god not a bit
So now this is my finale take a look into my alley
You've looked into the valley that exists in my mind
And you know, theres only me thats ever lived in mankind
And you know, I know that I won't live up to be like Christ,
And I know, that I'm so self aware I don't mean all my lines,
And you know, it's up to you to tell when I'm not lyin', so we know,
I'm only really doing half of the work,
The other half you gotta figure out what I'm saying
Do I really like rape, murder, incest am I playing?
Or am I being real about the shit that I'm claiming,
That's for you, this is my painting,
This is my pain, don't need to explain it
This is my life, we exist on different heights
We are living different lives we are seeing different nights,

The roots that are now free, so can you see,

It is all my addictions, it's my thoughts in diction
Personality through fiction, can you see my Night Vision?

[Outro - Sung]
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh,
Night Vision, oh oh oh oh,
Night Vision, Night Vision,
Night, Night Vision,
Night Vision Night, Night Vision, Night,`,

    title: "Saint Nick",
    lyrics: `[INTRO (speaking)]
I always be thinking in the future never the past. 
But sometimes I feel like I be forgettin' about the present.

[CHORUS]
Won't let them fail,
Don't be like me, Don't be like,
Go be yourself,
Don't be like me Don't be like me,

[VERSE]
If I had a son, I would tell him to be confident,
Always do what he wants, and never do what he doesn't,
He enjoy what wants to even if it seem irrelevant,
Stand strong and enjoy himself and ignore all the judgement,
From his peers who gon' see him and say that he egotistical,
Like they got cracks in they skull seeing someone that aint typical,
Teach him not to rely on others but not to isolate himself,
Isolation affects health, I see them in my nightmares,
I'd tell him not to get reliant on those he barely knows,
Trust don't grow on hoes or bros, tell him to rely on self,
Prioritize yourself, never no other, never a bitch,
A hoe, a man, who gon', try to, kill you, first,
Don't get immersed in the distractions they put down for you,
Stay in the present but look in the future, you ain't no shooter,
Raise him to be smart but not to be a nerd, not a dumbass
Who act like his class stoppin' him from taking the classes that he want,
Just to sound smart, but he sound stupid,
Tell the boy he better not get distracted by cupid,
Don't fall into echo chambers where they'll try to tell you,
That the only way you live is by making a fake you,
Make sure to hold onto him like, damn son I love you,
I will be a good father unlike the one before myself,
Spoil my son with wealth, cheery christmas bells,
I know he'll be great, cause he got me in his cells, yeah

[CHORUS]
Won't let them fail,
Don't be like me, Don't be like,
Go be yourself,
Don't be like me Don't be like me,

[VERSE 2]
If I had a daughter, I'd tell her to be confident
Baby I promise you'll stun, just don't show everyone,
your body, lookin' for more validation
Guys in your dm's lookin' like illegal immigration,
Don't get enough compliments you slick with frustration,
Go and focus on yourself and come to me for advice,
Shit I'm not a woman so this my best to prefice,
I'm a terrible person sometimes I forget my morals,
But i'll be there for you, my daughter and son too,
When they mention your father don't want you askin' back who,
Same way that I did, I know you'll stay committed,
To shit that you wanna do, feels like I already know you,
If you wanna sing baby girl I know you'll be a superstar,
Stand on the bodies of singers crownin' you the music tsar,
You wanna be an artist, shit I'll buy you a paintbrush,
Know you destined for greatness know you about to be famous,
Baby girl you wanna settle down and just go work a job,
Shit that's cool with me too, I'll be right here on thanksgivin'
I'll be right here when you need me, unlike the way my daddy wasn't,
If there's one single constant, you have my apartment,
If rent gets to high and you need somewhere to stay,
Shit I'm washin' your bedsheets, those blue ones and grays,
Don't care who you love, you can be straight or you can be gay,

[OUTRO]
But I love you, I love you, I love my son too,
But I love you, I love you too, I love my daughter too,
That's the shit that I'd say, if I had a son,
And if I had a daughter, somebody touch her,
That shit turn into slaughter, somebody touch my son,
Shit I'm grabbin' my gun, If somebody,
If somebody touch me, lettin' that shit happen,
Kill myself anyway before I have children,
Save them from the asshole that I'd probably be,
If I had a son, If I had a daughter,
Then I'm meant for the slaughter, for doin' that shit,
Sounds like torture, being the kid of me,
God set them free, my fault for being me, my fault for being,
My fault for beating me up, eating me up,
Thoughts I have that make me kill me, I mean,
Thank god for me, thank god for the day, and I had a-
If I had a son, or I had a daughter,
That'd prolly be torture, man, that'd prolly be torture,
And If I had a kid, then I'm retarded,
I'd prolly be a-,
Bad Father, with a bad daughter,
So I'll kill myself someday just to keep that from happening

[BEAT SWITCH]

[Chorus II]
God, forgive me for the sins that I feel,
My emotions I tried to bury and conceal,
My acts to seal away my insecurities,
Teasin' me with thoughts of evil actions and deeds,
I need to go to chuch and sit down in the pews
Confess to a preist like I'm drunken with booze,
Admit to god that I don't have an excuse,
Fucked up since youth and now I need your help lord,

[Verse 3]
God forgive me for the pride that I've shown,
Tried to love myself when I suffered from being alone,
My pride made me confident when I pick up the microphone,
Shoulda thought harder I guess that I shoulda known,
Like khalid saying we the best but we is just me,
Though inside I know I think of myself as less,
Do shit for others all cause I just strive to impress,
But not work on myself, insecure since twelve,
God forgive me for my lust the way I view double x,
For seeing the x as just a symbol of sex,
As if they don't have a soul and they don't have a life
I wanna kidnap one and go and make 'em my wife,
Thats why I aim to my heart when I pickup a knife,
Tempted to stick it in just to see if I can survive,
Let myself bleed out on the floor, please cry
When I die, show sympathy, I'm sorry,

[Chorus II]
God, forgive me for the sins that I feel,
My emotions I tried to bury and conceal,
My acts to seal away my insecurities,
Teasin' me with thoughts of evil actions and deeds,
I need to go to chuch and sit down in the pews
Confess to a preist like I'm drunken with booze,
Admit to god that I don't have an excuse,
Fucked up since youth and now I need your help lord,

God forgive me for my, Jealousy
I hate myself when I see others living in ecstasy,
I sometimes feel entitled thinking it is my destiny
To live great with a big house, shoulda been guaranteed,
And at the same time please forgive me for my greed,
What I thought was a need has just become a want
I dropped my morals, forgot to pickup my heart,
I pride myself for being smart but thoughts be so dark,
I know I know I let my anger take control of me
Lash out at the only ones who really tried to help me
Probably why nobody even really likes me
The ones that say they do they just lying to me,
I promise god that I'm tryna follow your rules
But I can't understand when my nature overrules
The things I've been taught, the ways that I should live,
So god I come here to beg for forgiveness of my sins,

[Chorus II]
God, forgive me for the sins that I feel,
My emotions I tried to bury and conceal,
My acts to seal away my insecurities,
Teasin' me with thoughts of evil actions and deeds,
I need to go to chuch and sit down in the pews
Confess to a preist like I'm drunken with booze,
Admit to god that I don't have an excuse,
Fucked up since youth and now I need your help lord,

[OUTRO, CHORUS x3]

[CHORUS]
Won't let them fail,
Don't be like me, Don't be like,
Go be yourself,
Don't be like me Don't be like me,
Won't let them fail,
Don't be like me, Don't be like,
Go be yourself,
Don't be like me Don't be like me,
Won't let them fail,
Don't be like me, Don't be like,
Go be yourself,
Don't be like me Don't be like me,`,
